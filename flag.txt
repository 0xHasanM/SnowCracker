Oh the weather outside is frightful	  	      	  		
But the fire is so delightful	   	       	    		    	 
And since we've no place to go     	     	   	  	   	   
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!	  	      	 	     	     
       	   	    	    	  	       	      		      	      
It doesn't show signs of stopping  	       	  	 	      
And I've bought some corn for popping	 	 	   	  
The lights are turned way down low
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

Oh! It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
and The lights are turned way down low
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

All the way home I'll be warm!
All the way home I'll be warm!

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!
